# Metrication
A browser extension for contextual unit and time converting.

## Brief History
Got fed up with converting units manually. Modified abandoned XUL-based Converter Addon to work as Web Extension in Firefox. Still contains tons of dead code. Hardcoded conversion to metric and EUR. Intended for personal use. Do with it whatever you want :).
